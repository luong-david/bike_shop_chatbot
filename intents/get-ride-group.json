Digestion can get harder as rides get longer, so eat more solids at the beginning of the ride, and switch to blocks, chews, and other easily-digested foods during the final part of the ride. Just be sure to drink plenty of fluid to chase down gels, so you don’t get GI upset.\nBonus Tip: Supplement bars and gels with carb-rich, low-protein, moderate-fat \"real\" foods. Don\u0027t worry about specific amounts of protein or fat; just eat what tastes good so you keep eating."
