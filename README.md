Instructions on Using Chatbot

The chatbot was built using Google DialogFlow.  There are two ways to run the chatbot.  You can request access through Identity and Access Management (IAM) and you will be able to see the agent with the name "master" in the DialogFlow console.  You may also pull the Github contents, create a zip file, and import it under the Export and Import tab in the DialogFlow gear setting.
